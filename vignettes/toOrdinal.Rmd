# Introduction

The package **toOrdinal** contains a single function `toOrdinal` that converts a cardinal number (e.g., 9) into its ordinal counterpart (e.g., 9th).
Because such conversions are language specific, the conversions are specific to a supported language. At present, the package implements English,
French, German, Spanish, and Swedish. For example,

* English: toOrdinal(1) returns '1st'
* German: toOrdinal(1, language="German") returns '1te'
* French: toOrdinal(1, language="French") returns '1re'
* Spanish: toOrdinal(1, language="Spanish") returns '1.er'
* Swedish: toOrdinal(1, language="Swedish") returns '1:a'


# Use

After [installing](https://dbetebenner.github.io/toOrdinal/index.html#installation) the package from either CRAN
or GitHub, it's simple to convert a cardinal to an ordinal number.

To convert cardinal to ordinal numbers in English (the default), supply the cardinal number to `toOrdinal`.

```{r}
toOrdinal(5)
```

Conversion in other languages are performed by supplying the appropriate language to the `language` argument:

```{r}
toOrdinal(5, language="German")
toOrdinal(5, language="French")
toOrdinal(5, language="Spanish")
toOrdinal(5, language="Swedish")
```

Current languages supported include: English, German, French, Spanish, and Swedish.


## Examples

The first argument, `n`, is the cardinal number to be converted to an ordinal number:

```{r}
sapply(1:10, toOrdinal)
```


# Contributions & Requests

If you have contribution (for example, another language) or a feature request for the **toOrdinal** package, don't hesitate to write or set up an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/toOrdinal/issues). Current new features include the possiblity of converting cardinal numbers to ordinal words
(e.g., 8 to eighth).
