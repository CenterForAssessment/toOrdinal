This is 1.0 release of the **toOrdinal** package. This release is about the creation of vignettes and
[web-documentation](https://CenterForAssessment.github.io/toOrdinal) for the package. However, the package now
supports:

* English: toOrdinal(1) returns '1st'
* German: toOrdinal(1, language="German") returns '1te'
* French: toOrdinal(1, language="French") returns '1re'
* Spanish: toOrdinal(1, language="Spanish") returns '1.er'
* Swedish: toOrdinal(1, language="Swedish") returns '1:a'

See the new [Getting Started Vignette](https://centerforassessment.github.io/toOrdinal/articles/toOrdinal.html) for more information.
