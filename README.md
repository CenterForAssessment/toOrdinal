# Overview

The function **toOrdinal** converts a cardinal number (e.g., 9) into its ordinal counterpart (e.g., 9th). Because such conversions are language specific,
the conversions are specific to a supported language. At present, the package implements English, French, German, Spanish, and Swedish. For example,

* English: toOrdinal(1) returns '1st'
* German: toOrdinal(1, language="German") returns '1te'
* French: toOrdinal(1, language="French") returns '1re'
* Spanish: toOrdinal(1, language="Spanish") returns '1.er'
* Swedish: toOrdinal(1, language="Swedish") returns '1:a'
